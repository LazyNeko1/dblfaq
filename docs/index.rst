   Important things you should know:

      - If you created a bot on https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ you must code that bot yourself and then run the code for it to come online. There is no way to "turn on the bot" or "power it on". Bot's are run using code and require code in order to have functionality.

      - Bot development does NOT start with adding your bot to https://top.gg/. Create your bot and make the code first. 

      - You can ask for help in the Development channel, but do NOT expect to be spoon fed.

           (https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/spoon-feed) 

Where can I submit my bot?
-----
  You can apply to add your bot here: https://top.gg/newbot
  
  You must be logged in to discord to add a bot.



Why did my bot get declined?
-----
   - Your bot did not follow our bot rules in the rules channel.

   - View the Mod Log channel for the reason your bot was declined and by what moderator.

   - Your bot is tested using permissions=0, you should ensure that your bot functions without permissions.

   - If the decline reason you received is not clear enough, you should contact the moderator for clarification.

How long does bot approval take?
-----
   - There is a queue of bots, so your bot will not be reviewed instantly.

   - It can take up to a week **(or longer)** for your bot to be approved or declined due to there being a queue of bots manually reviewed by people with the Website Moderators role.

   - Upon approval your bot will be added to this server and the "Bot Developer" role will automatically be given to you.

   - If in the chance your bot is denied for one of the reasons stated in #rules-and-info, you will find out why in #mod-log.

   Please be patient, Mods will get to your bot. 

Is minimodding allowed?
-----
 "Mini-Modding" or "Backseat Moderating" is when a member who is NOT a Moderator, takes up the role (of Moderator) by demanding other members or taking part in Moderator actions such as;


   - Requesting another member to move to the correct channels in a demanding manner.

   - Investigating issues that you can't help with ("Investigations" are done by Moderators and only Moderators).

   - Pestering a member to display their age to see if they are underage (although this isn't necessarily bad, some members have been found pestering members who don't wish to display their age).

     Although we follow the Discord Terms of Service, we are not out to witch hunt new members.

   - Attempting to handle situations in any of the channels when a Moderator is active or handling the situation themselves.

What is starboard?
-----
   
  A starboard is, simply put, a system that "saves" your message

   Content that is usually starboard worthy:

    1. Memes and other funny community content.

    2. That's pretty much it, it's mostly just for fun and games!

   Content that is not starboard worthy:

    1. Random messages that aren't really funny or entertaining at all.

    2. Your own messages, nobody wants to see your "Star this message for..." message.

    3. Advertisements or self promotions (obviously).

    4. Hateful messages of any kind.

   Not following the starboard rules will result in a mute. 
   
   Also, things that do NOT work:

    1. Starring Luca(bot)'s messages

    2. Starring your own messages

    3. Starring a muted user's messages



Luca's commands
----
  Prepend commands with the prefix `-` or `@Luca#0393`.

   Please refrain from using these commands in non testing channels.

   `-botinfo @bot` Shows bot info, title redirects to site listing.

   `-bots @user` Shows all bots of that user, includes bots in the queue.

   `-owner / -owners @bot` Shows all owners of that bot.

   `-prefix @bot` Shows the prefix of that bot.

   Add `-noembed` to the end of the command to get a mobile friendly version.

What is "DBL League"?
-----
The Discord Bot List League is an activity based, league-style competition that takes place in this server among all members. 

Essentially, the basics is that you send a message, and a bot will record it, as points.
