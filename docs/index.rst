   Important things you should know:

      - If you created a bot on https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ you must code that bot yourself and then run the code for it to come online. There is no way to "turn on the bot" or "power it on". Bot's are run using code and require code in order to have functionality.

      - Bot development does NOT start with adding your bot to https://top.gg/. Create your bot and make the code first. 

      - You can ask for help in the Development channel, but do NOT expect to be spoon fed (https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/spoon-feed) 


What is starboard?
-----
   
  A starboard is, simply put, a system that "saves" your message

   Content that is usually starboard worthy:

    1. Memes and other funny community content.

    2. That's pretty much it, it's mostly just for fun and games!

   Content that is not starboard worthy:

    1. Random messages that aren't really funny or entertaining at all.

    2. Your own messages, nobody wants to see your "Star this message for..." message.

    3. Advertisements or self promotions (obviously).

    4. Hateful messages of any kind.

   Not following the starboard rules will result in a mute. 
   
   Also, things that do NOT work:

    1. Starring Luca(bot)'s messages

    2. Starring your own messages

    3. Starring a muted user's messages
