   Important things you should know:

      - If you created a bot on https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ you must code that bot yourself and then run the code for it to come online. There is no way to "turn on the bot" or "power it on". Bot's are run using code and require code in order to have functionality.

      - Bot development does NOT start with adding your bot to https://top.gg/. Create your bot and make the code first. 

      - You can ask for help in the Development channel, but do NOT expect to be spoon fed (https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/spoon-feed)
